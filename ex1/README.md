## iostream

Fundamental to the `iostream` library are two types named `istream` and `ostream`, which represent input and output streams.  A stream is a sequence of characters read from or written to an IO device.  The term `stream` is intended to suggest that the characters are generated, or consumed, sequentially over time.

* cout (equivalent to stdout)
* cerr (equivalent to stderr)
